# Hey There :wave:. Welcome to the :cat: app!

There will be a button on the screen that you press to make cats appear.  It uses random numbers and a file with images of cats to randomly select which cats will appear next.

To get started, in your terminal, git clone the repository into the directory of your choosing and use *npm install* to install the required dependencies.  Next, in your terminal, type *gulp* to fire off the default command which loads everything you need.  Then open up *localhost:8080* in the browser of your choice.

## ENJOY! :ok_hand:
